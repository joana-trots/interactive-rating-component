## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

In this project I practiced using SASS Variables, Imports, Partials, Nesting, Mixins and Extends.

### Continued development

I'm going to learn more about SASS Modules and Operators for my future projects.

### Useful resources

- I found awesome and helpful gist with SASS Mixins of CSS Flexbox rules: (https://gist.github.com/richardtorres314/26b18e12958ba418bb37993fdcbfc1bd). 
Using it in my project at (assets/styles/_flexbox.scss). 
Thanks a lot to author!
